# Symptom Checker ML Model

An AI-based symptom checker designed with a complete ML training pipeline, multilingual support, and a deployment-ready FastAPI backend.

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a machine learning model that predicts possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms.  
It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, inferencing APIs, multilingual handling, and Docker-based deployment.  
The architecture is clean, modular, and suitable for real-world telemedicine workflows.

## 🧠 Model

The model uses classical ML techniques trained on symptom–disease mappings.  
Pipeline includes:

- Text preprocessing  
- Symptom feature extraction  
- One-hot encodings  
- Model training  
- Artifact saving  

Artifacts are stored in the `/artifacts` directory.

---

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

Supported languages:
- English  
- Hindi  
- Punjabi  

Inputs are normalized internally before prediction.

```

Run container:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 symptom-checker
```
